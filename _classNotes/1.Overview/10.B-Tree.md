# B-Tree

- A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems to store large amounts of data.
- They are designed to work well on disk storage, minimizing the number of disk accesses required to find or modify data.
- Each node in a B-tree can have multiple children and can store multiple keys, which allows for a high branching factor and reduces the height of the tree.

## B-Tree Design

- Example:

```
        [10, 20]
       /    |    \
      /     |     \
   [5]    [15]   [25, 30]
   / \     / \    /  |  \
  [1] [7] [12] [22] [27] [35]
```

- In this example, the root node contains two keys (10 and 20) and has three children. Each child node can also contain multiple keys.
- B-trees are characterized by the following properties:
  - Each node can have a variable number of keys and children, within a predefined range.
  - All leaves are at the same level, ensuring balanced height.
  - The keys in each node are sorted, allowing for efficient search operations.
