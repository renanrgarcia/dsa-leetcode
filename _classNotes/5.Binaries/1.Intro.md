# Binaries

- Numerical data is stored in binary format.
- Binary is the base-2 numeral system, using only two symbols: 0 and 1.
  - Example: The decimal number 5 is represented as 101 in binary.
- Each bit in a binary number represents a power of 2.
  - Example: The binary number 1011 represents (1 _ 2^3 + 0 _ 2^2 + 1 _ 2^1 + 1 _ 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11) in decimal.
- Least significant bit (LSB): the last bit in a binary number, indicating whether the number is even (0) or odd (1).
- Sign bit: the first bit in a binary number, indicating the sign of the number in signed binary representations (0 for positive, 1 for negative).
