# Sliding Window Technique

- The sliding window technique is a powerful algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. It involves maintaining a window that can expand and contract as needed to find solutions efficiently.
- This technique is particularly useful for problems where you need to find the maximum, minimum, or sum of elements in a subarray or substring, or when you need to check for specific conditions within a range.
- Common applications include:
  - Finding the maximum sum of a subarray of fixed size.
  - Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
  - Checking if a substring contains all characters of another string.
- Complexity:
  - Time complexity is often O(n) as each element is processed at most twice (once when added to the window and once when removed).
  - Space complexity is typically O(1) if done in place, or O(k) for additional data structures used to track elements in the window.
- Cook book:
  - Use two pointers to represent the current window's start and end.
  - Expand the window by moving the end pointer to include new elements.
  - Contract the window by moving the start pointer to exclude elements when necessary.
  - Maintain any required state (like sums or counts) as you adjust the window.

## Example Problems

1. **Finding the Maximum Sum of a Subarray of Fixed Size**

   - Given an array and a fixed size, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of that size.

   ```csharp
   int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
   int k = 3; // Size of the subarray
   int maxSum = 0;
   int currentSum = 0;

   for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++)
   {
       currentSum += arr[i];
       if (i >= k - 1)
       {
           maxSum = Math.Max(maxSum, currentSum);
           currentSum -= arr[i - (k - 1)]; // Remove the element going out of the window
       }
   }
   Console.WriteLine($"Maximum sum of subarray of size {k}: {maxSum}");
   ```

2. **Finding the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

   - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

   ```csharp
   string s = "abcabcbb";
   int left = 0;
   int right = 0;
   int maxLength = 0;
   HashSet<char> charSet = new HashSet<char>();

   while (right < s.Length)
   {
       if (!charSet.Contains(s[right]))
       {
           charSet.Add(s[right]);
           maxLength = Math.Max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
           right++;
       }
       else
       {
           charSet.Remove(s[left]);
           left++;
       }
   }
   Console.WriteLine($"Length of longest substring without repeating characters: {maxLength}");
   ```
