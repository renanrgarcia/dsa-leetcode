# Exponencial Search

- Exponencial Search is an algorithm for searching in a sorted array. It is particularly useful when the size of the array is unknown or very large.
- The algorithm works by first finding a range where the element might be present, and then performing a binary search within that range.
- The steps are as follows:
  1. Start with the first element and double the index until you find an element greater than the target or reach the end of the array.
  2. Once the range is found, perform a binary search within that range.
- The time complexity of Exponencial Search is O(log i) for finding the range and O(log n) for the binary search, making it efficient for large datasets.
- Space complexity is O(1) for the iterative implementation.
