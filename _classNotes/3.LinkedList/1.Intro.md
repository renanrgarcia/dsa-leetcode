# LinkedList

- A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored in a sequence. Each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as opposed to arrays where shifting elements is required.
- Linked lists can be singly linked (each node points to the next node) or doubly linked (each node points to both the next and previous nodes).
- The main advantages of linked lists over arrays include dynamic size, ease of insertion and deletion, and no need for contiguous memory allocation.

## Implementation

```csharp
public class Node
{
    public int Value;
    public Node Next;

    public Node(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
        Next = null;
    }
}

public class LinkedList
{
    private Node head;

    public LinkedList()
    {
        head = null;
    }

    // Add methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal
    public void Insert(int value)
    {
        Node newNode = new Node(value);
        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
        }
        else
        {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.Next != null)
            {
                current = current.Next;
            }
            current.Next = newNode;
        }
    }

    public void Display()
    {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null)
        {
            Console.Write(current.Value + " -> ");
            current = current.Next;
        }
        Console.WriteLine("null");
    }

    public void Delete(int value)
    {
        if (head == null) return;

        if (head.Value == value)
        {
            head = head.Next;
            return;
        }

        Node current = head;
        while (current.Next != null && current.Next.Value != value)
        {
            current = current.Next;
        }

        if (current.Next != null)
        {
            current.Next = current.Next.Next;
        }
    }

    public void Clear()
    {
        head = null;
    }

    public bool Search(int value)
    {
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null)
        {
            if (current.Value == value)
            {
                return true;
            }
            current = current.Next;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

```
