# Sliding Window Technique

- The sliding window technique is a powerful algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. It involves maintaining a window that can expand and contract as needed to find solutions efficiently.
- This technique is particularly useful for problems where you need to find the maximum, minimum, or sum of elements in a subarray or substring, or when you need to check for specific conditions within a range.
- Common applications include:
  - Finding the maximum sum of a subarray of fixed size.
  - Finding the longest substring without repeating characters.
  - Checking if a substring contains all characters of another string.
- Complexity:
  - Time complexity is often O(n) as each element is processed at most twice (once when added to the window and once when removed).
  - Space complexity is typically O(1) if done in place, or O(k) for additional data structures used to track elements in the window.
- Cook book:
  - Use two pointers to represent the current window's start and end.
  - Expand the window by moving the end pointer to include new elements.
  - Contract the window by moving the start pointer to exclude elements when necessary.
  - Maintain any required state (like sums or counts) as you adjust the window.
