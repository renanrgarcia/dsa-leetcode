# Two Pointer Technique

- The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure, often from opposite ends or at different speeds.
- This technique is particularly useful for problems involving pairs, triplets, or subarrays where you need to find specific conditions or relationships between elements.
- Common applications include:
  - Finding pairs with a specific sum.
  - Merging two sorted arrays.
  - Reversing a string or array in place.
  - Detecting cycles in linked lists.
- Complexity:
  - Time complexity is often O(n) for linear traversals.
  - Space complexity is typically O(1) if done in place.

## Example Problems

1. **Inverting a String**

   - Use two pointers to swap characters from the start and end of the string until they meet in the middle.

   ```csharp
   string str = "Hello, World!";
   char[] charArray = str.ToCharArray();
   int left = 0;
   int right = charArray.Length - 1;
   while (left < right)
   {
       char temp = charArray[left];
       charArray[left] = charArray[right];
       charArray[right] = temp;
       left++;
       right--;
   }
   string reversed = new string(charArray); // "!dlroW ,olleH"
   ```

2. **Inverting words in a string**
   - Split the string into words, then apply the two-pointer technique to reverse each word in place.
   ```csharp
   string sentence = "Hello World";
   string[] words = sentence.Split(' ');
   for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
   {
       char[] wordArray = words[i].ToCharArray();
       int left = 0;
       int right = wordArray.Length - 1;
       while (left < right)
       {
           char temp = wordArray[left];
           wordArray[left] = wordArray[right];
           wordArray[right] = temp;
           left++;
           right--;
       }
       words[i] = new string(wordArray);
   }
   string invertedSentence = string.Join(" ", words); // "olleH dlroW"
   ```
