# LinkedList Cycle

- A linked list cycle occurs when a node's next pointer points to a previous node in the list, creating a loop. Detecting a cycle is important to prevent infinite loops during traversal.
- There are several algorithms to detect a cycle in a linked list, with the most common being Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm).

## Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm

```csharp
public bool HasCycle(Node<T> head)
{
    if (head == null) return false;

    Node<T> slow = head;
    Node<T> fast = head;

    while (fast != null && fast.Next != null)
    {
        slow = slow.Next; // Move slow pointer by 1
        fast = fast.Next.Next; // Move fast pointer by 2

        if (slow == fast) // Cycle detected
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false; // No cycle found
}
```

- The algorithm uses two pointers: a slow pointer that moves one step at a time and a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(1) since it uses only a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

## Finding the Start of the Cycle

```csharp
public Node<T> FindCycleStart(Node<T> head)
{
    if (head == null) return null;

    Node<T> slow = head;
    Node<T> fast = head;

    // First step: detect cycle
    while (fast != null && fast.Next != null)
    {
        slow = slow.Next;
        fast = fast.Next.Next;

        if (slow == fast) // Cycle detected
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    // If no cycle, return null
    if (fast == null || fast.Next == null)
    {
        return null;
    }

    // Second step: find the start of the cycle
    slow = head; // Reset slow pointer to the head
    while (slow != fast)
    {
        slow = slow.Next;
        fast = fast.Next;
    }

    return slow; // The start of the cycle
}
```
