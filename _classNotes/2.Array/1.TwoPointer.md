# Two Pointer Technique

- The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or linked lists. It involves using two pointers to traverse the data structure, often from opposite ends or at different speeds.
- This technique is particularly useful for problems involving pairs, triplets, or subarrays where you need to find specific conditions or relationships between elements.
- Common applications include:
  - Finding pairs with a specific sum.
  - Merging two sorted arrays.
  - Reversing a string or array in place.
  - Detecting cycles in linked lists.
- Complexity:
  - Time complexity is often O(n) for linear traversals.
  - Space complexity is typically O(1) if done in place.
