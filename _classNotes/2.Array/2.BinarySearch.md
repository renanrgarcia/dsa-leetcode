# Binary Search

- A binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- Only applicable to sorted arrays or lists.
- The basic idea is to compare the target value to the middle element of the array:
  - If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete.
  - If the target value is less than the middle element, narrow the search to the lower half.
  - If the target value is greater than the middle element, narrow the search to the upper half.
- Complexity:
  - Time complexity is O(log n) due to the halving of the search space.
  - Space complexity is O(1) for iterative implementations or O(log n) for recursive implementations due to call stack.

## Example Problems

1. **Finding an Element in a Sorted Array**

   - Given a sorted array and a target value, find the index of the target using binary search.

   ```csharp
   int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
   int target = 3;
   int left = 0;
   int right = arr.Length - 1;
   while (left <= right)
   {
       int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
       if (arr[mid] == target)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Element found at index: {mid}");
           return;
       }
       else if (arr[mid] < target)
       {
           left = mid + 1;
       }
       else
       {
           right = mid - 1;
       }
   }
   Console.WriteLine("Element not found");
   ```

2. **Finding the First Occurrence of an Element**

   - Modify the binary search to find the first occurrence of a target value in a sorted array that may contain duplicates.

   ```csharp
   int[] arr = { 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
   int target = 2;
   int left = 0;
   int right = arr.Length - 1;
   int firstOccurrence = -1;

   while (left <= right)
   {
       int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
       if (arr[mid] == target)
       {
           firstOccurrence = mid; // Found an occurrence
           right = mid - 1; // Continue searching in the left half
       }
       else if (arr[mid] < target)
       {
           left = mid + 1;
       }
       else
       {
           right = mid - 1;
       }
   }

   if (firstOccurrence != -1)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"First occurrence of {target} is at index: {firstOccurrence}");
   }
   else
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Element not found");
   }
   ```
