# Shifts

- Shifting bits is a common operation in binary arithmetic.
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Moves bits to the left, effectively multiplying the number by 2 for each shift.
  - At the end of the shift, zeros are filled in from the right.
  - Until getting an overflow, we can say that this operation is equivalent to multiplying by 2.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Moves bits to the right, effectively dividing the number by 2 for each shift.
  - For unsigned numbers, zeros are filled in from the left.
  - For signed numbers, the sign bit is preserved (arithmetic shift).
  - The last bit (least significant bit (LSB)) is discarded.
  - Until getting an overflow, we can say that this operation is equivalent to dividing by 2.

```csharp
int num = 8; // 1000 in binary
int leftShift = num << 1; // 10000 in binary (16 in decimal)
int rightShift = num >> 1; // 0100 in binary (4 in decimal)
Console.WriteLine($"Left Shift: {leftShift}, Right Shift: {rightShift}");

int num5 = 5; // 0101 in binary
int leftShift5 = num5 << 1; // 1010 in binary (10 in decimal)
int rightShift5 = num5 >> 1; // 0010 in binary (2 in decimal)
Console.WriteLine($"Left Shift 5: {leftShift5}, Right Shift 5: {rightShift5}");
```
