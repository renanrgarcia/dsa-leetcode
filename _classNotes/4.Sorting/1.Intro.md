# Sorting

- How they work
- When one is better than another
- Which are the complexity of each
- Need to know how to implement at least one of them

  - Bubble Sort: best for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
  - Merge Sort: best for linked lists and large datasets.
  - Quick Sort: best for average cases and large datasets.
