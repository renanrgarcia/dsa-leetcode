# HashMap

- A HashMap is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
- HashMaps are widely used for their average-case O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- The worst-case time complexity can degrade to O(n) if many keys hash to the same index (collision), but this is rare with a good hash function and proper resizing.
- Space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the map.
- Common operations include:
  - **Insertion**: Adding a key-value pair.
  - **Deletion**: Removing a key-value pair.
  - **Lookup**: Retrieving the value associated with a key.

## Example Problems

1. Find the first non-repeating character in a string.

````csharp
```csharp
public int FirstNonRepeatingCharIndex(string s)
{
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(s)) return -1;

  Dictionary<char, int> charCount = new Dictionary<char, int>();

  // Count occurrences of each character
  foreach (char c in s)
  {
    if (charCount.ContainsKey(c))
    {
      charCount[c]++;
    }
    else
    {
      charCount[c] = 1;
    }
  }

  // Find the first non-repeating character and return its index
  for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
  {
    if (charCount[s[i]] == 1)
    {
      return i;
    }
  }

  // No non-repeating character found
  return -1;
}

// Example usage
string s = "swiss";
int index = FirstNonRepeatingCharIndex(s);
Console.WriteLine(index != -1
  ? $"First non-repeating character index: {index}"
  : "No non-repeating character found");
````

```

```
