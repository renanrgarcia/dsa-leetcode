# Hashmap

- A hashmap (or hash table) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
- Hashmaps are widely used for implementing associative arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets.
- They provide average-case constant time complexity O(1) for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making them very efficient for many applications.
- However, in the worst case (e.g., when many keys hash to the same index), the time complexity can degrade to O(n).
- Hashmaps can handle collisions using various methods such as chaining (where each bucket contains a linked list of entries) or open addressing (where a probing sequence is used to find an empty slot).
- In many programming languages, hashmaps are implemented as built-in data structures, such as `Map` in JavaScript, `HashMap` in Java, and `Dictionary` in C#.

## How to achieve O(1)

- To achieve O(1) time complexity in a hashmap, the `hash function` must distribute keys uniformly across the available buckets, minimizing collisions.
  - Example of a simple hash function:
  ```csharp
  int SimpleHash(string key)
  {
      int hash = 0;
      foreach (char c in key)
      {
          hash += c; // Sum of ASCII values
      }
      return hash % 16; // Assuming 16 buckets
  }
  ```
  - Common hash functions: MD5, SHA-1, and custom functions based on the data type of keys.

## Load Factor and Collision Resolution

- The `load factor` is a measure of how full the hashmap is, defined as the number of entries divided by the number of buckets. A common load factor threshold is 0.75, meaning the hashmap will resize when it reaches 75% capacity.
  - Number of entries / Number of buckets = Load Factor
  - When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hashmap can be resized (usually doubled in size) and all existing entries rehashed to the new buckets.
- The `collision resolution` is a technique used to handle situations where multiple keys hash to the same bucket. Common methods include:
  - Chaining: Each bucket contains a linked list of entries.
  - Open addressing: Find another open bucket using a probing sequence.

## Hashmap Implementation

```csharp
public class HashMap<TKey, TValue>
{
    private class Entry
    {
        public TKey Key;
        public TValue Value;
        public Entry Next; // For handling collisions using chaining

        public Entry(TKey key, TValue value)
        {
            Key = key;
            Value = value;
            Next = null;
        }
    }

    private Entry[] buckets;
    private int size;

    public HashMap(int capacity = 16)
    {
        buckets = new Entry[capacity];
        size = 0;
    }

    private int GetBucketIndex(TKey key)
    {
        return Math.Abs(key.GetHashCode()) % buckets.Length;
    }

    public void Put(TKey key, TValue value)
    {
        int index = GetBucketIndex(key);
        Entry current = buckets[index];

        while (current != null)
        {
            if (current.Key.Equals(key))
            {
                current.Value = value; // Update existing key
                return;
            }
            current = current.Next;
        }

        // Add new entry
        Entry newEntry = new Entry(key, value);
        newEntry.Next = buckets[index];
        buckets[index] = newEntry;
        size++;
    }

    public TValue Get(TKey key)
    {
        int index = GetBucketIndex(key);
        Entry current = buckets[index];

        while (current != null)
        {
            if (current.Key.Equals(key))
            {
                return current.Value; // Found the key
            }
            current = current.Next;
        }

        throw new KeyNotFoundException("Key not found: " + key);
    }

    public bool ContainsKey(TKey key)
    {
        try
        {
            Get(key);
            return true; // Key exists
        }
        catch (KeyNotFoundException)
        {
            return false; // Key does not exist
        }
    }

    public int Count => size; // Returns the number of entries in the hashmap
}
```
