# Reverse Linked List

- Reversing a linked list is a common algorithmic problem that involves changing the direction of the pointers in the list so that the head becomes the tail and vice versa.
- This can be done iteratively or recursively.

## Iterative Approach

```csharp
public void Reverse()
{
  Node<T> previous = null;
  Node<T> current = head;
  Node<T> next = null;

  while (current != null)
  {
    next = current.Next;
    current.Next = previous;
    previous = current;
    current = next;
  }
  head = previous;
}
```

- This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a few pointers to keep track of the nodes.

## Recursive Approach

```csharp
public Node<T> ReverseRecursive(Node<T> node)
{
  if (node == null || node.Next == null)
  {
    return node;
  }

  Node<T> newHead = ReverseRecursive(node.Next);
  node.Next.Next = node;
  node.Next = null;
  return newHead;
}
```

- The recursive approach also has a time complexity of O(n), but it has a space complexity of O(n) due to the call stack used for recursion.

## Using a support list

```csharp
public LinkedList<T> ReverseUsingSupportList()
{
    LinkedList<T> reversedList = new LinkedList<T>();
    Node<T> current = head;

    while (current != null)
    {
        reversedList.Insert(current.Value);
        current = current.Next;
    }

    return reversedList;
}
```
