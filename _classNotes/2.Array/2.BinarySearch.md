# Binary Search

- A binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- Only applicable to sorted arrays or lists.
- The basic idea is to compare the target value to the middle element of the array:
  - If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete.
  - If the target value is less than the middle element, narrow the search to the lower half.
  - If the target value is greater than the middle element, narrow the search to the upper half.
- Complexity:
  - Time complexity is O(log n) due to the halving of the search space.
  - Space complexity is O(1) for iterative implementations or O(log n) for recursive implementations due to call stack.
