# Graph

- Graphs are a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. They can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
- A graph can be represented visually as a set of points (nodes) connected by lines (edges).
- Nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between them.
- Use cases include social networks, transportation systems, and network routing.
- Example of a simple undirected graph:

  ```
  A -- B
  |    |
  C -- D
  ```

- In this example, A, B, C, and D are nodes, and the lines represent edges connecting them.
- Example of a directed graph:

  ```
  A → B
  ↑   ↓
  C ← D
  ```

- Example of fully connected graph (complete graph):

  ```
  A -- B
  | \ / |
  | / \ |
  C -- D
  ```

- Example of a weighted graph:

  ```
  A --(2)--> B
  |          |
  (1)        (3)
  |          |
  C --(4)--> D
  ```
