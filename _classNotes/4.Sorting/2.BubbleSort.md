# Bubble Sort

- Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
- It is not suitable for large datasets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
- Complexity:
  - Time: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).
  - Space: O(1) as it requires only a constant amount of additional space for

## Implementation

```csharp
public void BubbleSort(int[] arr)
{
    int n = arr.Length;
    bool swapped;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    {
        swapped = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
        {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
            {
                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        // If no two elements were swapped, the array is sorted
        if (!swapped) break;
    }
}
```
