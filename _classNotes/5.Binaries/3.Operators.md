# Operators

## And (&)

- The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 only where both corresponding bits are 1.
- When applied to two equal numbers, the result is the same number.
- When applied to a number and 0, the result is 0.
- When applied to a number and 1, we can discover the least significant bit (LSB) of the number (0 for even, 1 for odd).

```csharp
int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a & b; // 0001 in binary (1 in decimal)
Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise AND: {result}");
```

## Or (|)

- The bitwise OR operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 where at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
- When applied to two equal numbers, the result is the same number.
- When applied to a number and 0, the result is the same number.
- When applied to a number and 1, the result is the number with the least significant bit (LSB) set to 1 always.

```csharp
int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a | b; // 0111 in binary (7 in decimal)
Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise OR: {result}");
```

## Xor (^)

- The bitwise XOR operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 where the corresponding bits are different.
- When applied to two equal numbers, the result is 0.
- When applied to a number and 0, the result is the same number.
- When applied to a number and 1, the result is the number with the least significant bit (LSB) flipped.

```csharp
int a = 5; // 0101 in binary
int b = 3; // 0011 in binary
int result = a ^ b; // 0110 in binary (6 in decimal)
Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise XOR: {result}");
```

## Not (~)

- The bitwise NOT operator inverts all the bits of a number, turning 0s into 1s and 1s into 0s.
- When applied to a number, the result is the bitwise complement of that number.
  - In practice, this means that the result is the negative of the number minus one in two's complement representation.

```csharp
int a = 5; // 0...00000101 in a 32-bit signed integer
int result = ~a; // 1...11111010 in binary, which is -6 in decimal
Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise NOT: {result}"); // Output: Bitwise NOT: -6
```

## Missing number problem

- The missing number problem involves finding a number that is missing from a sequence of numbers.
- A common approach is to use the XOR operator, which has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`.

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 4, 5 }; // Missing number is 3
int missingNumber = 0;
foreach (int num in numbers)
{
    missingNumber ^= num;
}
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    missingNumber ^= i;
}
Console.WriteLine($"Missing number: {missingNumber}");
```

## Number of steps to reduce a number to zero

- The number of steps to reduce a number to zero can be calculated using bitwise operations.

```csharp
int number = 14;
int steps = 0;

while (number > 0)
{
    if ((number & 1) == 1)
    {
        number--;
    }
    else
    {
        number >>= 1;
    }
    steps++;
}

Console.WriteLine($"Number of steps to reduce to zero: {steps}");
// Output for 14 is: 6
```
