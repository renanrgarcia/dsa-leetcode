# Middle of a Linked List

- Finding the middle of a linked list is a common problem that can be solved using the two-pointer technique, where one pointer moves twice as fast as the other.
- This approach allows us to find the middle node in a single pass through the list.

## Two-Pointer Technique

```csharp
public Node<T> FindMiddle(Node<T> head)
{
    if (head == null) return null;

    Node<T> slow = head;
    Node<T> fast = head;

    while (fast != null && fast.Next != null)
    {
        slow = slow.Next; // Move slow pointer by 1
        fast = fast.Next.Next; // Move fast pointer by 2
    }

    return slow; // Slow pointer will be at the middle node
}
```

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

## Scrolling through Technique

```csharp
public Node<T> FindMiddle(Node<T> head)
{
    if (head == null) return null;

    Node<T> current = head;
    int count = 0;

    // Count the total number of nodes
    while (current != null)
    {
        count++;
        current = current.Next;
    }

    // Find the middle index
    int middleIndex = count / 2;
    current = head;

    // Traverse to the middle node
    for (int i = 0; i < middleIndex; i++)
    {
        current = current.Next;
    }

    return current; // Return the middle node
}
```

- This method also has a time complexity of O(n) but requires two passes through the list: one to count the nodes and another to find the middle node. The space complexity remains O(1).
