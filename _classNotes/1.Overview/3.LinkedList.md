# Linked List

- A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- Big Os (Although we need to analyze the worst case, we will also mention the best case that's commonly used):
  - Read: O(n) - Worst, O(1) - Best
  - Insert: O(n) - Worst, O(1) - Best
  - Delete: O(n) - Worst, O(1) - Best

## Linked List vs Array

- **Memory Allocation**: Arrays allocate a contiguous block of memory, while linked lists allocate memory for each node separately.
- **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, while arrays have a fixed size.
- **Insertion/Deletion**: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is more efficient than in an array, especially for large datasets, as it does not require shifting elements.
- **Access Time**: Accessing elements in an array is faster (O(1)) compared to a linked list (O(n)), as linked lists require traversal from the head node to the desired node.
- **Memory Overhead**: Linked lists have additional memory overhead for storing pointers to the next (and possibly previous) nodes, while arrays do not have this overhead.

## Singly Linked List

- A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.
- Each node in a singly linked list has two components:
  - **Value**: The data stored in the node.
  - **Next**: A reference to the next node in the list.

```csharp
public class Node<T>
{
    public T Value { get; set; }
    public Node<T> Next { get; set; }

    public Node(T value)
    {
        Value = value;
        Next = null;
    }
}
public class SinglyLinkedList<T>
{
    private Node<T> head;

    public void Add(T value)
    {
        Node<T> newNode = new Node<T>(value);
        if (head == null)
        {
            head = newNode;
        }
        else
        {
            Node<T> current = head;
            while (current.Next != null)
            {
                current = current.Next;
            }
            current.Next = newNode;
        }
    }

    public void PrintList()
    {
        Node<T> current = head;
        while (current != null)
        {
            Console.Write(current.Value + " -> ");
            current = current.Next;
        }
        Console.WriteLine("null");
    }
}
```
