# Binary Tree

- A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
- Node: A basic unit of a binary tree containing data and references to its children.
- The top node is called the `root`, and nodes with no children are called `leaves`.
- Design:

  ```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \   \
  D   E   F
  ```

  Where:

  - A is the root
  - B and C are children of A
  - D and E are children of B
  - F is a child of C

## Types of Binary Trees

- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node other than the leaves has two children.

  - Example:

  ```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \   / \
  D   E F   G
  ```

- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

  - Example:

  ```
      A
     /  \
    B    C
   / \   /
  D   E F
  ```

- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

  - Example:

  ```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \ / \
  D  E F  G
  ```

- **Balanced Binary Tree**: The height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where for each node, the left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

  - Example:

  ```
      4
     / \
    2   6
   / \ / \
  1  3 5  7
  ```

- **Heap**: A special type of binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where the key of each node is greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to (min-heap) the keys of its children.

  - Max-Heap Example:

  ```
      10
     /  \
    9    8
   / \  /
  7   6 5
  ```

  - Min-Heap Example:

  ```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4  5 6  7
  ```
