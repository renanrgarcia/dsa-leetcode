# Exponencial Search

- Exponencial Search is an algorithm for searching in a sorted array. It is particularly useful when the size of the array is unknown or very large.
- The algorithm works by first finding a range where the element might be present, and then performing a binary search within that range.
- The steps are as follows:
  1. Start with the first element and double the index until you find an element greater than the target or reach the end of the array.
  2. Once the range is found, perform a binary search within that range.
- The time complexity of Exponencial Search is O(log i) for finding the range and O(log n) for the binary search, making it efficient for large datasets.
- Space complexity is O(1) for the iterative implementation.

## Example Problems

1. Find the position of a target value in a large sorted array.

```csharp
int[] arr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
int target = 5;
int result = ExponentialSearch(arr, target);
Console.WriteLine(result != -1 ? $"Element found at index: {result}" : "Element not found");

// Exponential search method
static int ExponentialSearch(int[] arr, int target)
{
  if (arr.Length == 0)
    return -1;

  // Step 1: Find the range
  int index = 1;
  while (index < arr.Length && arr[index] < target)
  {
    index *= 2; // Double the index
  }

  // Step 2: Perform binary search in the found range
  int left = index / 2;
  int right = Math.Min(index, arr.Length - 1);
  return BinarySearch(arr, target, left, right);
}

// Binary search method
static int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int target, int left, int right)
{
  while (left <= right)
  {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == target)
    {
      return mid;
    }
    else if (arr[mid] < target)
    {
      left = mid + 1;
    }
    else
    {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```
