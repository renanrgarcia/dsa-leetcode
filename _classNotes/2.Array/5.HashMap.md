# HashMap

- A HashMap is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
- HashMaps are widely used for their average-case O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- The worst-case time complexity can degrade to O(n) if many keys hash to the same index (collision), but this is rare with a good hash function and proper resizing.
- Space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the map.
- Common operations include:
  - **Insertion**: Adding a key-value pair.
  - **Deletion**: Removing a key-value pair.
  - **Lookup**: Retrieving the value associated with a key.
